# AirBnB_price_prediction

At the Airbnb platform, anyone who has a room or a property of any type (apartment, house, etc.) can offer their property to be rented daily/montlhly.

You create a host profile (person who makes a property available for rent per night) and create your property listing.

In this case, the host should describe the properties of the property as completely as possible, in order to help the tenant to choose the best property for them (and in order to make your ad more attractive)

There are dozens of possible customizations in your listing, from minimum daily rate, price, number of rooms, to cancellation rules, extra fee for extra guests, requirement to verify the landlord's identity, etc.

### Our goal

The goal here is to help new hosts to guess their prices based on a Machine Learning Model. Here we assume that the host does not have more than 6 properties to register on Airbnb.
